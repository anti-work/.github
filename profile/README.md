# Hi there, we're [Anti-Work](https://antiwork.com)! 👋

## 🙋‍♀️ Automating the boring stuff that ran Gumroad.
Anti-Work emerged from Gumroad's mission to automate repetitive tasks. In 2025, we're taking a bold step by open-sourcing our entire suite of tools that helped run and scale Gumroad. We believe in making powerful automation accessible to everyone.
